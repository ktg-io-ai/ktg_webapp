- Add database query optimization and caching
- Implement lazy loading for module content
- Add minification for CSS/JS assets
- Consider implementing WebSocket for real-time features

## Best Practices & Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **File Organization Compliance**
   - Move `DATABASE_STRUCTURE.md` to `docs/` folder
   - Consolidate all documentation in `docs/` directory
   - Update references to moved files

2. **Image Upload System**
   - Replace base64 encoding with file upload to server storage
   - Implement image compression before storage
   - Add CDN integration for better performance

3. **Error Handling Standardization**
   - Implement consistent error response format across all APIs
   - Add proper logging for debugging and monitoring
   - Create error handling middleware for Express

4. **Testing Implementation**
   - Add unit tests for critical API endpoints
   - Implement integration tests for user flows
   - Add automated testing to development workflow

### Medium-Term Improvements

1. **Code Consolidation**
   - Create shared component library for common UI elements
   - Standardize CSS variables and styling patterns
   - Implement build process for asset optimization

2. **Security Enhancements**
   - Add comprehensive input validation middleware
   - Implement rate limiting and DDoS protection
   - Add security headers and HTTPS enforcement

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement caching strategy for database queries
   - Add CDN for static assets
   - Optimize database indexes based on query patterns

4. **Monitoring & Analytics**
   - Add application performance monitoring
   - Implement user analytics and behavior tracking
   - Add system health monitoring and alerting

### Long-Term Strategic Initiatives

1. **Scalability Preparation**
   - Design microservices architecture for high-traffic modules
   - Implement database sharding strategy
   - Plan for horizontal scaling of application servers

2. **Advanced Features**
