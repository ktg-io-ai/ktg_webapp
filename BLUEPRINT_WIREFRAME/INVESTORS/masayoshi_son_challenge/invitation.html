Join the Masayoshi Son Challenge

Dear [Recipient's Name],

They say we are all just six degrees of separation from anyone in the world. Today, you have the chance to put that theory to the test—while unlocking a revolutionary vision.

We invite you to participate in the Masayoshi Son Challenge, a high-stakes, real-world experiment in connectivity. The goal? Use the power of your network to reach Masayoshi Son, SoftBank, or The Vision Fund. If your connection chain succeeds, you and everyone along the path will split 6 million KTG Tokens—including Masayoshi himself.

But this is more than just a game. It is a prototype for the future of human and professional connection, an AI-powered, self-sustaining ecosystem that:

Facilitates real, meaningful networking – bridging personal and professional relationships with AI-driven matchmaking around gamified classifieds.
Fights fraud, scams, and exploitation – reducing human trafficking risks through identity-verifiable connections, gamification algorithms, and Web2 tokenization.
Empowers an influencer and gig economy – where influencers monetize their followings, and players mint 30-day cycle memories as NFTs.
Creates financial and social capital – with a projected market cap designed to rival industry leaders in the AI-driven social marketplace, pioneering a new paradigm in ad sales and lifestyle marketing.

How It Works:
Register - Get your unique referral link at: https://www.karmathegame.org/dashboard_masa.html
Send the challenge - Forward this invitation to trusted contacts.
Track your progress - See real-time analytics as your network grows.
Win when we reach Masayoshi Son - The winning branch shares the 6M KTG prize.

This is your chance to be part of something massive—a movement that could redefine how people meet, collaborate, and innovate.

Let's make history together.

Best,
Rene Reyes, Founder
