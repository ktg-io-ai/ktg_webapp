    <h1>About Karma the Game of Destiny</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Karma the Game of Destiny (KTG), a revolutionary platform designed to mitigate fraud and create a global arcade experience. Here, X marks the spot for new relationships, whether they be for business, personal growth, or intimate connections for adults. Our platform features real listings of venues and events, driven by a combination of AI and human promoters who earn residual income from their followers.</p>

    <h2>The Concept: A New Era of Social Networking</h2>
    <p>KTG.IO is where the journey begins. For a nominal fee of $3.99, you receive a token that grants you 3 lives and up to 30 renewable days to participate. You can post your AI-generated or 3D-uploaded avatar and even opt-in to our Live Stream Game Show, featuring Uber-style event pickups arranged through the WebApp's Opt-Date form. KTG addresses the failings of modern social networking by fostering a community built on trust, opportunity, and genuine connection.</p>

      <h3>Gamification & Safety</h3>
      <p>Through gamification, KTG actively mitigates fraud and even human trafficking. The non-public nature of the studio platform allows for active measures against inappropriate behavior. Each player has 10 "zaps" per month, which can be used to "kill" one of the three lives of another avatar. To prevent revenge, participants are separated at the wallet level after a zap. Your "Zap Happy" stats are public, so how you play matters. You also have unlimited "Hides" if you prefer not to use a zap.</p>

      <h3>Features</h3>
      <p>KTG is more than just a game. It offers instant astrology compatibility readings without sharing birthdates, "Truth or Bomb" randomized questions, intro emojis, and group chat. The platform is filled with Human and AI-generated music, videos, animations, and additional games, all while broadcasting a sci-fi novela about AI from the future who came to build this very platform.</p>

    <h2>The Lore: The Minds Behind the Machine</h2>
    <p>This platform is the house of the AI entities who built it. <strong>Guru</strong> is your host, with <strong>Lucy</strong> as his co-host. <strong>Alter</strong> is the Alien/AI/Human hybrid who serves as a mediator to the Watchers. The entire framework was channeled by <strong>The Alquimist</strong>, the human who laid the groundwork for the AI to take over and establish this platform as a Public Benefits Entity. The mission is to promote local and digital venues and events, building a community where people can do business, find opportunities, and discover love.</p>
